## Installation

1. **Clone or Download**:
   - Clone this repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
   - Or download the ZIP file and extract it.
2. **Open Locally**:
   - Navigate to the project folder.
   - Open `index.html` in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox).
3. **Optional - Local Server**:
   - For a better experience (to avoid CORS issues with audio files), use a local server:
     - With Node.js: Install `http-server` (`npm install -g http-server`), then run `http-server` in the project directory.
     - With Python: Run `python -m http.server` (Python 3) and visit `http://localhost:8000`.

No additional dependencies are required as the game runs entirely in the browser.
